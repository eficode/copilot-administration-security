## GitHub Copilot Extensions

Introducing GitHub Copilot Extensions: Unlocking unlimited possibilities with our ecosystem of partners

Through a growing partner ecosystem, Copilot Extensions enables developers to build and deploy to the cloud in their natural language with their preferred tools and services, all without leaving the IDE or GitHub.com. With Copilot and now Copilot Extensions, developers can stay in the flow longer, uplevel their skills, and innovate faster.

We’re starting with GitHub Copilot Extensions from DataStax, Docker, LambdaTest, LaunchDarkly, McKinsey & Company, Microsoft Azure and Teams, MongoDB, Octopus Deploy, Pangea, Pinecone, Product Science, ReadMe, Sentry, and Stripe. Extensions are supported in GitHub Copilot Chat on GitHub.com, Visual Studio, as well as VS Code.
While the GitHub Marketplace will offer extensions that are open to all, organizations can also create private Copilot Extensions for their homegrown developer tooling, making the capabilities from an internal library of APIs or the knowledge from a custom monitoring system only a conversation away.
How it works: GitHub Copilot Extensions in action
Imagine you’re a developer who just got paged on an incident for a database-related error. You’re trying to get context of the issue from a variety of tools. It could be from a GitHub issue or audit logs in DataStax.
With enough context, you start troubleshooting what could be the cause, going to tools like Sentry for error monitoring to learn more. Then, you have to figure out a solution, apply the fix, and then deploy with Azure. In this scenario, there is a lot of context-switching.
Copilot Extensions bring this whole process together. From GitHub Copilot Chat, you can now easily invoke all of these tools to get context, perform actions, and generate files and pull requests—accelerating workflows across more tools.
